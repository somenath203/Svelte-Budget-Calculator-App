# Svelte-Budget-Calculator-App

This is an Budget Calculator Application created with the help of Svelte.js where the user can add all the expenses he/she wants to track and the total amount of all the expenses will be calculated dynamically. Here, in this app, the user also has the option to edit and delete a particular expense or delete all the expense altogether at once.

<br />

This app also has the feature of local storage means if the user refreshes the page after adding some expenses or closes the website and then, again reopens it, then the expenses will remain as it.

## Get started

Install the dependencies...

```bash
cd Svelte-Budget-Calculator-App
npm install
```

...then start [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org):

```bash
npm run dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see your app running. Edit a component file in `src`, save it, and reload the page to see your changes.

By default, the server will only respond to requests from localhost. To allow connections from other computers, edit the `sirv` commands in package.json to include the option `--host 0.0.0.0`.

If you're using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we recommend installing the official extension [Svelte for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=svelte.svelte-vscode). If you are using other editors you may need to install a plugin in order to get syntax highlighting and intellisense.
